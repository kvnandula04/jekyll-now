Make Time - John Zeratsky <br />
Getting Things Done <br />

Notes:
Mission and vision are different. <br />
Mission - how you want the world to be different with the work you're doing. <br />
Vision - a mental picture of what it would look like if you persued that mission. <br />
A vision helps see what you can do to get 'there' so it's useful. <br />

Getting stuff done isn't the same as doing the stuff. <br />
