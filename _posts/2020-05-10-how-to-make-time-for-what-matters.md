## Notes:
Mission and vision are different. <br />
Mission - how you want the world to be different with the work you're doing. <br />
Vision - a mental picture of what it would look like if you persued that mission. <br />
A vision helps see what you can do to get 'there' so it's useful. <br />

Getting stuff done isn't the same as doing the stuff. <br />

## Steps to make time:
1) Highlight - Make time (Defense)
2) Laser - Stay focused(eliminate distractions) (Offense)
3) Energise - Simple ways to take care of yourself so that you have energy to do what you want.
4) Reflect - Look back and take notes on what worked for you.
