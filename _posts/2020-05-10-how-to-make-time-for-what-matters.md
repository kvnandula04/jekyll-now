## Books Mentioned: <br />
Make Time - John Zeratsky <br />
Getting Things Done - David Allen<br />
The Sprint<br />

## Mission vs Vision:
Mission and vision are different. <br />
Mission - how you want the world to be different with the work you're doing. <br />
Vision - a mental picture of what it would look like if you persued that mission. <br />
A vision helps see what you can do to get 'there' so it's useful. <br />

Getting stuff done isn't the same as doing the stuff. <br />

## Steps to make time: <br />
1) <strong>Highlight</strong> - Make time (Defense) <br />
2) <strong>Laser</strong> - Stay focused(eliminate distractions) (Offense) <br />
3) <strong>Energise</strong> - Simple ways to take care of yourself so that you have energy to do what you want. <br />
4) <strong>Reflect</strong> - Look back and take notes on what worked for you. <br />

<strong>How do you think about what your highlight should be vs what your to-do list should be? </strong><br />
 - Use your highlight to design/structure what the rest of the day looks like. <br />
 - Our experience of life is based on what we pay attention to. <br />
 - A highlight is essentially a focusing tool on top of what you're already commited to. <br />
 
<strong>How do you think about goals? </strong><br />
 - Think of goals as directions not destinations. <br />
 - They're more like stepping stones to structure your day. <br />
 - When we focus too much on goals, we put ourselves in a situation where we can't win.<br />

 <strong> Types of Goals</strong><br />
 - Numerical goals - <i>I wanna get x subscribers</i> <br />
 - Progress goals - <i>improving quality of videos</i><br />
 
 It's perhaps better to think of goals as progress as opposed to numerical.<br />
 
 <strong>The 'Might-Do' List ðŸ˜‚</strong><br />
 
 It's essentially a list that doesn't have any commitments. 
 It has some rules:
 - Plaintext/ unprecious
 - No ranking or prioritising.<br />
 
 Similar to goals, a to-do list is like a guide to remind you what you need to. The actual task isn't done until you translate the to-do list to an action. <br />
 
 ## Differences between GTD and Make Time <br />
Make Time is really a focusing system to figuire out what matters. It mainly provides tools to avoid distractions and build energy to your system. GTD however, is more of a system that you have to follow to enjoy its benefits. Make Time is not an organisational system. It's more of a tool. <br />
 
 - Don't get trapped in finding the perfect productivity system.
