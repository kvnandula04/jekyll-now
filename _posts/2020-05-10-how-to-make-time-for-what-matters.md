Make Time - John Zeratsky <br />
Getting Things Done <br />

## Notes:
Mission and vision are different. <br />
Mission - how you want the world to be different with the work you're doing. <br />
Vision - a mental picture of what it would look like if you persued that mission. <br />
A vision helps see what you can do to get 'there' so it's useful. <br />

Getting stuff done isn't the same as doing the stuff. <br />

## Steps to make time: <br />
1) <strong>Highlight</strong> - Make time (Defense) <br />
2) <strong>Laser</strong> - Stay focused(eliminate distractions) (Offense) <br />
3) <strong>Energise</strong> - Simple ways to take care of yourself so that you have energy to do what you want. <br />
4) <strong>Reflect</strong> - Look back and take notes on what worked for you. <br />

<strong>Q) How do you think about what your highlight should be vs what your to-do list should be? </strong><br />
Use your highlight to design/structure what the rest of the day looks like. <br />
Our experience of life is based on what we pay attention to. <br />
It's essentially a focusing tool on top of what you're already commited to. <br />
