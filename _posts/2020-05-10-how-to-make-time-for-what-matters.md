## Books Mentioned:
1) <strong>Make Time</strong> - John Zeratsky <br />
2) <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> - David Allen<br />
3) <strong>The Sprint</strong> - John Zeratsky <br />
4) <strong>Story Worthy</strong> - Mathew Dicks <br />

## Mission vs Vision:
Mission and vision are different. <br />
Mission - How you want the world to be different with the work you're doing. <br />
Vision - A mental picture of what it would look like if you persued that mission. A vision helps see what you can do to get 'there' so it's useful. <br />

Getting stuff done isn't the same as doing the stuff. <br />

## Steps to make time: 
<details>
<summary>1) <strong>Highlight</strong> - Make time (Defense)</summary><br />
 
 <strong>How do you think about what your highlight should be vs what your to-do list should be? </strong><br />
 - Use your highlight to design/structure what the rest of the day looks like. <br />
 - Our experience of life is based on what we pay attention to. <br />
 - A highlight is essentially a focusing tool on top of what you're already commited to. <br />
 
<strong>How do you think about goals? </strong><br />
 - Think of goals as directions not destinations. <br />
 - They're more like stepping stones to structure your day. <br />
 - When we focus too much on goals, we put ourselves in a situation where we can't win.<br />

 <strong> Types of Goals</strong><br />
 - Numerical goals - <i>I wanna get x subscribers</i> <br />
 - Progress goals - <i>improving quality of videos</i><br />
 
 It's perhaps better to think of goals as progress as opposed to numerical.<br />
 
 <strong>The 'Might-Do' List ðŸ˜‚</strong><br />
 
 It's essentially a list that doesn't have any commitments. It has some rules:<br />
 - Plaintext/ unprecious. <br />
 - No ranking or prioritising. <br />
 
 Similar to goals, a to-do list is like a guide to remind you what you need to. The actual task isn't done until you translate the to-do list to an action. <br />
 
#### Differences between GTD and Make Time
Make Time is really a focusing system to figuire out what matters. It mainly provides tools to avoid distractions and build energy to your system. GTD however, is more of a system that you have to follow to enjoy its benefits. Make Time is not an organisational system. It's more of a tool. <br />
 
 - Don't get trapped in finding the perfect productivity system.<br />



#### Becoming a Morning Person
 - When you wake up early with a task that you know you want to do, it provides a motivation to power yourself to wake up early. <br />
 - Staring at a screen immeditely before sleep can be super disruptive before you go to bed. If you wanna wake up early, first thing you have to do is sleep early. And to do this, you have to set a time to put away your devices so that you aren't distracted. <br />
 
#### How do you start?
 - Break down big things to small things.
 - Start in the middle. Pick the thing that feels like a good place to jump in. <br />
 - Dive in where you can dive in and spread out from there.
 
#### How to do tasks when they don't have a deadline?
 - Schedule days where you think you can do the task.
 - Create deadlines for yourself.

#### What are the best ways to stay focused on tasks?
 - Create friction for social media. For example, use auto-generated passwords that you can't remember and save it in some document. Every time you're done with the social media app, logout. Whenever you're drawn in, you'll be stuck with the login page and so you will basically retire to your original task.
