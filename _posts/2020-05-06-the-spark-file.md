This is a simple concept where if you come across an idea that you think you can write about in the future, write it down as and when you come across it into a file that can be accessed from anywhere(Notion for example). The format should be in a reverse chronological order so that you can retrospect easily. The thing with this concept is that sometimes there will be an idea worth writing about but sometimes they kind of "expire" but by the end of it you'd have so many ideas that you have a large collection to work with. It's essentially a precaution to avoid losing a potentially great idea. It's a concept that I've always known and want to implement but I haven't so I am creating one in Notion right now ðŸ™‚!
