If you want to integrate all 3 of these elements(productivity, creativity and self reflection) to your life, essentially you need to plan and schedule your calendar.
According to him, there's no way that you can hit the nail on the head for this however, there are some good methods. <br />

<strong>1) Productivity</strong>
Set aside a day for a task like -> content creation -> blogging -> schoolwork -> deep learning etc. 
This way you don't have to cram everything and the task switching cost is low and won't leave you feeling unproductive. <br />

<strong>2) Creativity</strong>
By following the above, you can equally set aside a day or 2 where you do creative things preferably in the morning. 
An example is drawing and taking your time with it. <br />

<strong>3) Reflection</strong>
Set aside an 'off-grid' time where you're allowed to write but not read. 
And lose yourself in nature. Ideally speaking spend some time away from the normal life.
Go for a trip or something. And make sure you preplan and book everything so that you're forced to do it. 
Forcing yourself in this context is healthy as you're doing it to disconnect form life.
