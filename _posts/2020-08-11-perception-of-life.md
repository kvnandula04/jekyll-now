### What is the purpose?

To have fun! It&#39;s an **adventure**. But unfortunately, many of us have built outdated and overly well-established systems which are immobilising this very purpose.

One of the examples is schools. There are many flaws with the education system but I won&#39;t get into an unhealthy ramble now. As I haven&#39;t blogged it yet, I&#39;ll leave that for another separate series where I can go in-depth(am sure you&#39;ll be fed up with it by the end lol).

Recently though, I have watched a video by Visa and I was completely staggered. His idea was that &#39;life is an adventure disguised as an ordeal&#39;. I would back that idea. It&#39;s such a beautiful way to look at it because it prompts even the people who claim that life has no meaning, to unwrap the ordeal and discern the adventurous aspect of life.

Another point that stems from this idea is something I&#39;ve gathered from inspirational people including Da Vinci, Newton and Einstein, to name a few. I would classify them under the adventure seekers section to a degree. This is because they let their imagination drive their curiosity. The result of this is that the turn their life into an adventure.

&quot;Adventure is about letting your curiosity lead.&quot;

It&#39;s the imagination which makes life more interesting. And right from a young age, kids build up a sense of curiosity for everything. They get nosy and ask, what&#39;s this, what&#39;s that and I kinda miss that! Not that I don&#39;t have it now, but, I&#39;ve certainly diminished in it. I believe one of the reasons for this is the education system which &#39;cages&#39; the curious imagination... Anyway, I firmly believe that curiosity drives a sense of adventure for life and that, in my opinion, is a worthy purpose for life.

### Ups and downs?

I believe that it&#39;s a series of mini-challenges that you subscribe to and try to accomplish. There are ups and downs yes! And the obstacle is to hustle through them whilst enjoy them. It&#39;s an adventure man, so the least it can be is enjoyable.

Another important thing is to be able to conquer them. I feel like one of the invaluable lessons life teaches us is to use the opportunities! It trains us to constantly attempt and never give up. With many achievers in various fields, this spirit is common. They strive for something that may seem such a trivial achievement for some. But this yearning to strive is inherent in our lives. I am a huge fan of this. I believe that I am pretty spirited with the idea of never giving up and by constantly training it, I am establishing a firm framework for future &#39;ups and downs&#39; that I am going to confront. And it almost seems like a recurring loop. I&#39;m going a bit off-topic...

The wonderful thing that I perceive from my trivial understanding of life is that I&#39;m going to witness a lot of bumps along the road. There will be pitfalls, far worse than I am currently facing, in my professional career and I am maximising my chances to prepare for them. I am in a way excited for that though! I want to see my capability to spring up from a fallback.

I conceive this to be another purpose for life.

### Durability

We don&#39;t know how long we will be here. It&#39;s unpredictable. This is why we should maximise our use of opportunities. Where you are offered them, you should grab it! I have been consciously bad at this because I have never had this particular perception in the past. During my high school years, I didn&#39;t necessarily sign up to things even when they were vaguely interesting. There&#39;s a great deal that comes out of doing this(signing up to things)...

You build a habit of subscribing which has a great ROI! But, I can&#39;t blame myself now for not signing up, so, I try to remind myself to grab an opportunity when I am presented with one.

My vision of life at the moment is that it&#39;s a linear journey from birth to death and I do not believe in any &#39;circular/multiple life experiences&#39; concepts at the moment. So, my effort would be to maximise what I can reap out of my existence in a hopefully adventurous and exciting way! This is why I am going to try to take up as many opportunities as possible.

### What do I actually think of opportunities?

In a general sense, life is full of opportunities. Everywhere you go, there&#39;s a chance to show something! This miraculous possibility is something that is underrated in my opinion. How can we &#39;harness&#39; this? Well, I haven&#39;t even started my journey of using my opportunities fully! I have such a huge collection of possible ventures and sometimes I get overwhelmed by just how much there is! I mean, life is full of life man!

Just ponder. There are around 7.5 billion people around the world! The amount of &#39;stuff&#39; happening is just mind-blowing.

This is why in a &#39;non-general&#39; sense, I do sometimes think that there&#39;s an element of competition in life. I find that opportunities are challenges and they fabricate a competitive atmosphere.

### Privilege

Writing about the privilege we have demands more than a blog. But here are some of my thoughts. I believe that we are very privileged to live in a world like this. Most of the problems and facts I am talking about are first-world and that idea in itself is befouled. Despite the numerous achievements we have accomplished, there are still ridiculous problems around the world which I am chased by. We need to work towards creating a space for adventure in everyone&#39;s lives and not ruin the very purpose of our existence. Let&#39;s try to enjoy life and treat it just like another opportunity instead of outright competition.
