Some information about you!

### More Information

I am Karthik Nandula and I am the Admin and one of the content writers at KARSID. I love writing travel blogs and programming. I have created several applications for a broad range of platforms and I am also a Udemy teacher with over 30,000 students. If you would like to know more about me, check out my portfolio. If you would like to read my blogs, check out my blog. Enough of the intro, what even is this?

This is a collection of useful and interesting links and notes that I have come across. There are programming notes, drafts, potential ideas, blog links and exciting videos. Through this, I hope to document my learnings. And I hope that it can help you discover something new. Go ahead and explore this wild garden! But be carefulâ€¦

This is quite a new project. You may not find a lot of content in the garden at the momentâ€¦ ðŸ˜• Iâ€™ll grow it quickly though, donâ€™t worry! ðŸ™‚
