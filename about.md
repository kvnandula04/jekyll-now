### hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! We are KARSID and welcome to our blog!

### about us ðŸ’ª

From a young age, travelling has been an instrumental way of building experiences for us. And it became a habit for us to pen our experiences on paper as soon as we returned home â€“ which allowed the writing to be as original and realistic as possible. Of course, this was with a slight nudge from our father who has constantly motivated us to savour these writings for us to look back when weâ€™re older. Quickly, it became a hassle to maintain physical copies of our adventures which sparked the initiation of this website. 

With adventure-packed trips to fascinating places all around the world now, this blog is now slowly developing into what weâ€™d originally set out on. And whilst its primary focus is to share our travel experiences, it also encourages us to share writings about any topic for that matter which is why you may find a few tech and sports-related blogs as well.

We hope to write as many of our experiences as possible and hopefully, we can mature into a full-fledged travel blog in the future.
