### hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Karthik Nandula and I am a passionate programmer. I have created several applications for a broad range of platforms including Alexa Skills which have over 40,000 users. I am also a [Udemy instructor](https://www.udemy.com/user/karthik-nandula/) with over 40,000 students. If you would like to know more about me, check out [my portfolio](https://www.karsidonline.com/portfolio/). If you would like to read my blogs, check out [my blog](https://www.karsidonline.com/). Enough of the intro, what even is this?

This is a mind garden/personal wiki. It's a collection of useful and interesting links and notes that I have come across. There are programming notes, drafts, potential ideas, blog links, exciting videos and more. Through this, I hope to document my learnings. And I hope that it can help you discover something new. Go ahead and explore this wild garden! But be careful near the stinging nettles.

If you're interested, you can see a list of all my favourites [here](https://www.notion.so/karthiknandula/Favourites-2f30c202f6f74559b23773fbd48b0c00).
