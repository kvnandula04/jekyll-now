### hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Karthik Nandula and I am the Admin and one of the content writers at [KARSID](https://www.karsidonline.com/). I love writing travel blogs and programming. I have created several applications for a broad range of platforms and I am also a [Udemy teacher](https://www.udemy.com/user/karthik-nandula/) with over 38,000 students. If you would like to know more about me, check out [my portfolio](https://www.karsidonline.com/portfolio/). If you would like to read my blogs, check out [my blog](https://www.karsidonline.com/). Enough of the intro, what even is this?

This is a digital garden. It's a collection of useful and interesting links and notes that I have come across. There are programming notes, drafts, potential ideas, blog links, exciting videos and more. Through this, I hope to document my learnings. And I hope that it can help you discover something new. Go ahead and explore this wild garden! But be careful near the stinging nettles.
